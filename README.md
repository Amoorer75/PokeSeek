# Project Proposal: PokéSeek
## Description:
PokéSeek is a new Pokédex website that allows beginners and seasoned veterans to find more information on their favorite Pokémon that is not often provided in other Pokédex. For beginners, it allows them to explore any Pokémon that appears on our homepace or through the search bar. Once they click on this Pokémon, it will display their type, image, and some simple information such as location. For more experienced players, information such as berries needed, a Pokémon's environment, and the different natures will be included. This project will show these features using the first generation's 150 Pokémon.

## API Being Used: [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co)

## Requirements:

To mee the mandatory requirements for the project there will be regularly held meetings between me and my partner and a timeline that will break the project down in phases:
### Phase 1: 
11/29 - 12/4 - Create base layout to display basic information (HTML/CSS) + Simple display of all 150 Pokémon
### Phase 2:
12/5 - 12/11 - Add Search feature and selection ability/Testing phase
### Phase 3:
12/12 - 12/15 - Final touches + Project Presentation

* Regular meetings will be held during these time frames under the availabilty of each member :)

## Additonal Considerations: 
* Randomized Pokémon at the opening of the homepage
* Animations for each pokemon in place of a static image using a second API
* Inclusion of other more advanced info such as: Breeding, Evolution Scale, and Items
